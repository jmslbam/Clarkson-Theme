# Custom Post Types
It autoloads a default [Object](https://github.com/level-level/Clarkson-Core/blob/master/post-objects/Clarkson_Object.php)
just like WP_Post but with some more handy stuff. When you register a Custom Post Type
ll_company your custom class ll_company gets loaded in the objects variable within
archive-company.twig.
