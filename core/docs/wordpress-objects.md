# WordPress objects
Clarkson ships with a set of PHP classes that represent the available WordPress data types.
The main Clarkson [Object](https://github.com/level-level/Clarkson-Core/blob/master/post-objects/Clarkson_Object.php){:target="_blank"} class represents `WP_Post` and has the `post_type` : `post`.  
This class represent the `WP_Post` but with some more handy stuff.
