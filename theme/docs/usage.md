# Tool usage

We try to limit all the moving part as much as possible. You're not required to use any of these tools and just code
 in vanilla CSS, but at one point in your development process they come in handy. Visit one of the dedicated documentation
  pages below:

- [Gulp](/theme/docs/usage-gulp.html)
- [BrowserSync](/theme/docs/usage-browsersync.html)
- [NPM](/theme/docs/usage-npm.html)
