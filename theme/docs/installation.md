# Installation
Clone the repository or download the zip and rename it to your project's name.
`git clone git@github.com:level-level/Clarkson-Theme.git`

## Install Gulp and Bower
Building the theme requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/). We recommend you update to the latest version of npm: `npm install -g npm@latest`.

From the command line:

1. Install [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [Bower](http://bower.io/) globally with `npm install -g gulp bower`
2. Navigate to them theme directory, then run `npm install`
3. Run `bower install`

You now have all the necessary dependencies to run the build process.
