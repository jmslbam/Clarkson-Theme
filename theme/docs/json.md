# JSON endpoint
One can call the JSON endpoint `https://clarkson.example/post-name/json` for each post and get a json object returned instead of using the whole WP REST-API.  


Code reference in [Core](https://github.com/level-level/Clarkson-Core/blob/master/lib/clarkson-core-templates.php#L21){:target="_blank"} and in [Theme](https://github.com/level-level/Clarkson-Theme/blob/master/functions/rewrites.php){:target="_blank"}.

> If you want te help and integrate Clarkson WordPress objects with the WP REST-API, please do. Then we can use that instead of this current solution.
